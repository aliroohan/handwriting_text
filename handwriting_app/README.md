# Handwriting Synthesizer App

A Flutter mobile application that converts typed text into handwritten style based on a provided handwriting sample.

## Features

- **Upload Handwriting Sample**: Take a photo or select from gallery
- **Text Input**: Enter any text you want to convert
- **Handwriting Synthesis**: Generates text in the style of the provided handwriting sample
- **Save & Share**: Save generated handwriting to gallery or share with others
- **Interactive Preview**: Zoom and pan on generated images

## How It Works

1. **Handwriting Analysis**:
   - Analyzes uploaded handwriting sample
   - Extracts style parameters (stroke width, slant, spacing, etc.)
   - Detects ink color and character dimensions

2. **Text Synthesis**:
   - Converts input text into handwritten strokes
   - Applies extracted style parameters
   - Adds natural variations (jitter, baseline variation)
   - Generates character paths with realistic hand movement

3. **Rendering**:
   - Creates canvas with proper dimensions
   - Draws text with appropriate line breaks
   - Exports as high-quality PNG image

## Key Technologies

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile framework
- **Image Processing**: Dart image library for analysis
- **Canvas Drawing**: Flutter's custom painting APIs
- **Provider**: State management
- **Image Picker**: Camera and gallery access
- **Share Plus**: Sharing functionality
- **Gallery Saver**: Save to device gallery

## Installation & Setup

1. Install Flutter SDK (if not already installed)
2. Clone this project
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Connect a device or start an emulator
5. Run `flutter run` to start the app

## Usage

1. **Upload Sample**: Take a photo of handwritten text or select from gallery
2. **Enter Text**: Type the text you want to convert
3. **Generate**: Tap "Generate Handwriting" button
4. **Save/Share**: Save to gallery or share the result

## Current Implementation

The current implementation includes:
- Basic handwriting style extraction from images
- Simplified character generation with basic strokes
- Natural variations (jitter, slant, baseline)
- Full UI/UX flow

## Future Enhancements

To make this a production-ready app, consider:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Use TensorFlow Lite for better style extraction
   - Neural network-based character generation
   - More accurate handwriting synthesis

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Multiple handwriting styles library
   - Character-by-character style learning
   - Pressure sensitivity simulation
   - Ligature and connection handling

3. **Customization Options**:
   - Adjust ink color after generation
   - Fine-tune style parameters
   - Multiple paper backgrounds
   - Line guides and margins

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Background processing for large texts
   - Caching of analyzed styles
   - Batch processing capabilities

## Notes

This is a demonstration implementation that shows the concept of handwriting synthesis. For production use, you would need to implement more sophisticated algorithms for:
- Character recognition and mapping
- Style transfer techniques
- Natural handwriting variations
- Better stroke generation

The app provides a solid foundation that can be extended with machine learning models or more advanced image processing techniques.
